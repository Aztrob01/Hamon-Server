# Hamon-Server
Hamon Server(Hardware Monitor Server) is a Personalized Task Manager that sends data to an Internal HTML server, what carries this info to any device with a Navigator. 

# Hamon: How it works? 
Hamon is a Simple Python Program using Python to receive and send data to an HTML server.
Hamon uses psutil and cpuinfo to get CPU, Memory and Disk data and send's that to an Flask HTML Server, creating a "Task Manager" that enable you to see your infos in your Tablet, Smartphone, Computer or Mini-Monitor.

# For WHAT Excactly you make it?
I have an Samsung Tablet (Galaxy Tab 3 -- T111M) and, as a Computer Science student, thinking in a way to better use this tablet, i created that program optimized to work on this tablet and help me fixing overloads. Sadly, optimize this program to run in that Tablet cost to me a lot of time, but i started to forget that initial idea and focus on the development before making him accessible for all end-users. Hamon now is a study work and my personal key to learn about programing applications and websites.
